# Hangman Game ðŸŽ®

This Python project is a simple command-line version of the **Hangman** game. The game randomly selects a word from a list, and the player must guess the word one letter at a time. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The player wins by guessing the word before the hangman is fully drawn.

## How to Play

1. Start the Game:  
   The program selects a random word from the word list.
   
2. Input:  
   You are prompted to guess a letter. The game shows the current state of the word, with unguessed letters represented by underscores (`_`).

3. Guesses:  
   - Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word.
   - Incorrect guesses draw part of the hangman and decrease your remaining attempts.

4. Win Condition:  
   Guess the word before running out of attempts. If you successfully guess all the letters, you win!

5. Lose Condition:  
   If the hangman is fully drawn (i.e., you run out of attempts), you lose, and the correct word is revealed.

## Example Gameplay

```bash
 _                                             
| |                                            
| |__   __ _ _ __   __ _ _ __ ___   __ _ _ __
